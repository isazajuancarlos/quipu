# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Quipu Security Lab — Etapa B (offline bench)**: timing / side-channel harness
  (surface 2: constant-time `ct_eq` and passphrase-independent `decode` timing)
  and an AI-accelerated password-guessing cost model (surface 3: verifies the
  Argon2id per-guess cost floor holds and that a ranked wordlist never cracks).
  Gated behind a new non-default `lab-offline` feature (implies `lab`, not run by
  CI) and shipped with an isolated `quipu-lab` OCI container (`--network none`,
  non-root, read-only, no real keys). Rust-only and reproducible; the container is
  documented as "ML-ready". Run with `bash lab/run.sh` or
  `cargo run --release --example securitylab_offline --features lab-offline`.
- **Python bindings for the hybrid signature mode**: `generate_signing_keypair`,
  `encode_signed` and `decode_verified` are now exposed to Python, reaching
  Rust/Python parity for the signature API. `quickstart.py` and the Python test
  suite cover the signed round-trip and rejection of wrong/tampered artifacts.
- **Quipu Security Lab (Etapa A)**: a self-hosted *adaptive* red-team behind a
  non-default `lab` Cargo feature (never compiled into the published crate or the
  PyPI wheel — "the weapon does not ship with the product"). A deterministic,
  seed-reproducible engine drives breach-guided attacks over two surfaces:
  ciphertext/format length-leak distinguishing (surface 1) and adaptive signature
  forgery — frankensignatures, key-substitution and region tampering (surface 4).
  Ships three anti-abuse locks: compile-time isolation, a tamper-evidence guard
  that fails CI if the antihacker defenses (`ct_eq`, KDF-param validation, `wipe`)
  are weakened, and a hash-chained findings corpus. Run with
  `cargo run --example securitylab --features lab`.

### Planned
- Independent security audit and public remediation of findings.
- Written specification with machine-readable interoperability test vectors.
- Multi-language bindings over the C ABI (C / Node.js / Go).
- Reference deployment of the online VOPRF hardening server.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Hybrid signature mode** (asymmetric authenticity): Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65
  (FIPS-204) combined with an **AND** verification combiner — a signature is valid
  only if *both* verify, so it stays unforgeable as long as at least one primitive
  survives. Signatures bind the signer's full verifying key and a
  `quipu/v3/sign` domain label into the signed preimage to prevent key
  substitution and cross-component mixing. New `pqsign` module and
  `api::encode_signed` / `api::decode_verified` (a signed-but-plaintext `QSG1`
  container: authenticity + non-repudiation, not confidentiality).
- **Red-team coverage**: hackerbot `forgery_attack` (tamper each symbol of a
  signed artifact; every mutation must fail verification).

### Security
- Signing keys are stored as 32-byte seeds and zeroized on drop; Ed25519 uses
  strict verification (rejects small-order keys and malleable signatures).
- Signature primitives are vetted third-party crates (`ed25519-dalek`, `ml-dsa`);
  zero `unsafe` in first-party code preserved.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-01

First public release. Published to crates.io (`quipu`) and PyPI
(`quipu-crypto`).

### Added
- **Symmetric mode** (passphrase): Argon2id + HKDF-SHA256 key derivation with
  NFKC normalization and optional pepper; XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD; 68-byte
  authenticated container header bound as AAD.
- **Hybrid post-quantum mode** (asymmetric): X25519 + ML-KEM-768 (FIPS-203)
  combined via HKDF with X-Wing-style transcript binding (recipient's full public
  key + encapsulation).
- **Verifiable online hardening mode**: VOPRF over ristretto255 with
  non-interactive DLEQ proofs (RFC 9497 style); the client cryptographically
  detects a dishonest hardening server. Includes a dependency-free TCP server.
- **Visual channels**: lossless PNG output, a native glyph alphabet, and a robust
  print channel with Reed-Solomon error correction.
- **Length hiding** via Padmé padding.
- **Defensive layers**: key zeroization (`zeroize`), constant-time comparison
  (`subtle`), KDF-parameter validation against malicious headers.
- **Internal tooling**: a red-team component ("hackerbot") and a test platform.
- **Bindings**: Python via PyO3 (abi3, CPython 3.9+); Rust `rlib` + C-ABI
  `cdylib`.
- **Docs**: internal pre-audit, threat model, licensing (dual AGPL + commercial),
  runnable Rust and Python quickstart examples.

### Security
- All cryptographic primitives are vetted third-party crates; zero `unsafe` in
  first-party code.
- Verified against Google Wycheproof AEAD vectors; Miri (no UB) and `cargo-fuzz`
  (no crashes) on the pure-logic and parsing modules; `cargo-audit` in CI.
- **Not yet independently audited** — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
